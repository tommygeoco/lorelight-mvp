# Production Readiness Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the production readiness status of Lorelight MVP as of October 2025.

## ✅ Code Quality

### Linting & Type Safety
- **ESLint**: 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅
- **TypeScript**: 1 expected Immer+Map warning (documented, runtime safe) ✅
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled ✅
- **Console Logs**: Removed (console.error retained for production logging) ✅

### Code Organization
- Service layer pattern for all data operations ✅
- Zustand stores with Immer for state management ✅
- Component-based architecture with clear separation ✅
- Custom hooks for reusable logic ✅
- TypeScript interfaces for all props and data models ✅

## ✅ Performance

### Optimization Strategies Implemented
- **Audio Preloading**: Last played track preloaded on mount
- **Lazy Loading**: Service instantiation on-demand
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, rollback on error
- **Memoization**: useMemo for expensive calculations (gradients, filters)
- **Debounced Operations**: Auto-save with 500ms debounce
- **CSS Animations**: Moved to globals.css for GPU acceleration

### Performance Targets
- Scene switch: Target <100ms (achieved through preloading)
- Audio resume: Target <50ms (achieved through persistence)
- Page interactions: Optimistic updates for instant feedback

## ✅ Error Handling

### Consistent Patterns
- **Service Layer**: All errors caught, logged, and re-thrown
- **Store Layer**: Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for all user-facing errors
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context via logger utility
- **API Routes**: Authentication checks, proper error responses

### Error Types Handled
- Network failures (retry logic in R2 uploads)
- Authentication errors (redirect to login)
- Validation errors (user-friendly messages)
- File upload errors (corrupted audio detection)
- Database constraint violations (RLS policy failures)

## ✅ Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables ✅
- Server-side authentication using `getUser()` (not session) ✅
- API routes require authentication ✅
- User isolation enforced at database level ✅

### Environment Variables
- All secrets in `.env.local` (not committed) ✅
- `.env.example` provided as template ✅
- Validation on startup ✅

### File Upload Security
- Cloudflare R2 with signed URLs ✅
- File type validation (audio formats only) ✅
- File size limits enforced ✅
- Retry logic with exponential backoff ✅

## ✅ Database

### Schema Design
- **Campaigns**: Top-level organization
- **Sessions**: Game sessions within campaigns
- **Scenes**: Pre-configured audio + lighting states
- **Audio Files**: Cloud-stored with metadata (tags, folders, playlists)
- **Session Scenes**: Many-to-many relationship table
- **Hue Settings**: Per-user Philips Hue authentication

### Migrations
- All migrations in `/supabase/migrations/` ✅
- Incremental migration strategy ✅
- Database indexes for query performance ✅

## ✅ Testing

### Pre-Production Checks
```bash
npm run lint        # ✅ Passes
npm run typecheck   # ✅ 1 expected warning
npm run build       # ✅ Successful
```

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Audio playback across different browsers
- [ ] Philips Hue integration with physical lights
- [ ] Large file uploads (50MB+)
- [ ] Multi-session concurrent usage
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Audio Playback
- Browser autoplay policies may require user interaction
- Some audio formats may not be supported in all browsers
- Large files (>100MB) may have slow upload times

### Philips Hue
- Requires local network access to Hue Bridge
- OAuth flow requires HTTPS in production
- Bridge discovery may fail on complex networks

### Performance
- Development server has 1-2s delay (Next.js compilation)
- Production build recommended for performance testing

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set all required environment variables in hosting platform
- [ ] Configure Supabase project (URL, anon key, service role key)
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare R2 bucket (account ID, access keys)
- [ ] Set up Philips Hue OAuth app (if using Hue features)

### Build & Deploy
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify production build
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Netlify/similar platform
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (required for Hue OAuth)

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify database migrations ran successfully
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test audio upload and playback
- [ ] Test Philips Hue integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitor error logs for first 24 hours

## 📚 Documentation for New Developers

### Essential Files
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Development guide, architecture, common issues
2. **README.md** - Getting started, installation, basic usage
3. **PRODUCTION_READY.md** (this file) - Production readiness status
4. **.env.example** - Required environment variables template

### Key Concepts
- **Service Layer Pattern**: All database operations go through `/lib/services/`
- **Zustand + Immer**: State management with Map support (requires `enableMapSet()`)
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, rollback on error
- **Source Tracking**: Audio player tracks playback source (library/playlist/scene)

### Common Gotchas
- `createServerSupabaseClient` is async - always await
- Immer+Map requires `enableMapSet()` at module top
- TypeScript depth warning is expected (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- Audio preloading requires user interaction in some browsers

### Development Workflow
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run lint       # Check for linting errors
npm run typecheck  # Check TypeScript types
npm run build      # Build for production
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment Status

**Ready for Production**: YES ✅

**Recommended Platform**: Vercel (Next.js optimized)

**Minimum Requirements**:
- Node.js 18+
- Supabase project
- Cloudflare R2 bucket
- (Optional) Philips Hue Bridge for lighting features

**Estimated Setup Time**: 30-45 minutes for experienced developers
