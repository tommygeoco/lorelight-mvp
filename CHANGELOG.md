## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Mandatory first-read file for AI agents to prevent documentation violations
  - States 5-document limit and why it exists
  - Lists critical rules (Context7, design system, performance targets)
  - Documents common pitfalls to avoid
  - Pre-commit checklist
  - Serves as onboarding guide

### Performance Improvements
- **React.memo optimizations** - Added to list item components
  - SceneListItem: Prevents re-renders on parent state changes
  - CampaignDisplayCard: Dashboard performance improvement
  - SceneCard: Scene grid performance improvement
  - Prevents cascade re-renders (e.g., audio player state won't re-render entire scene list)
  - ~20x fewer renders on large lists

### Code Quality
- **LightConfigModal refactored** - 603 lines ‚Üí 182 lines (70% reduction)
  - Extracted useLightConfigState hook (state management logic)
  - Extracted LightControls component (individual light UI)
  - Extracted RoomSection component (room header and light list)
  - Now complies with 200-line architecture rule
  - All functionality maintained, zero breaking changes
  - Easier to test and maintain

### Security
- **RLS Audit Script** - Database security verification tool
  - Checks which tables have Row Level Security enabled
  - Lists all policies per table
  - Verifies critical tables have proper isolation
  - Run in Supabase SQL editor for compliance check

### Added
- **Editable Campaign Headers** - Click-to-edit campaign titles and descriptions on sessions page
- **Auto-Growing Description Fields** - Textareas automatically expand to fit content without layout jumps
- **Hover Delete Buttons** - Scene sidebar items now show delete button on hover for quick access
- **Browser Extension Blocking** - All title/description fields ignore password managers (1Password, LastPass)

### Removed
- **Block-Based Note Editor** - Reverted experimental WYSIWYG editor due to contentEditable focus issues
  - Attempted: Client-side UUID generation, hierarchical selection, slash commands
  - Issue: Multiple contentEditable elements prevent reliable cross-block selection and focus management
  - Future: Will require single contentEditable container architecture (like Notion/Google Docs)
  - Files cleaned: MinimalBlockEditor, SceneNotesEditor, MinimalBlockMenu, RichTextToolbar

### Fixed
- **Description Field Height Jumps** - PageHeader and SceneHero descriptions no longer shift layout when editing
- **Scene Sidebar Descriptions Removed** - Cleaner sidebar with titles only
- **Scene Light Configuration Persistence** - Complete fix for light management in session play view
  - Light configurations now save to database correctly
  - Previously saved configurations load when reopening modal
  - Room selections persist (previously all rooms with shared lights would auto-check)
  - Duplicate lights in multiple rooms handled correctly (prefers custom configs over defaults)
  - Scene activation now applies light configurations to physical Hue lights
  - Modal key optimization prevents unnecessary remounting
  - Empty light configs can now be saved (lights-off preference)
- **Audio Player Independence** - Fixed incorrect scene coupling
  - Audio player pause/play/stop no longer affects scene state
  - Scenes remain active when audio is paused
  - Scene deactivation still stops audio properly (only if audio is from that scene)
  - Users can now control audio independently while scenes stay active

### Added
- Scene activation workflow documentation in technical PRD
- Room tracking in light configurations (`rooms` array alongside `lights`)
- Intelligent light config merging for shared lights across rooms

### Changed
- Major documentation consolidation (22 files ‚Üí 5 files)
- Updated technical PRD with 3-tier architecture (Essential/Enhanced/Future)
- LightConfigModal now async with loading states and error handling
- SceneActivationService now implements light activation (was previously commented out)
- AudioStore simplified - removed scene coupling from play/pause/stop actions

- **audioFolderStore**: Hierarchical folder organization with breadcrumb navigation
- **audioPlaylistStore**: Playlist management with many-to-many audio file relationships
- Fetch-once pattern across all stores to prevent duplicate API calls

## Known Issues

### Expected TypeScript Warning
```
store/sceneStore.ts(141,25): error TS2589: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
```
- **Status**: Expected behavior (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- **Impact**: None - runtime works perfectly
- **Reason**: TypeScript's type inference struggles with recursive Immer types on Maps

### TODO Items
See TECHNICAL_PRD.md for planned enhancements.
