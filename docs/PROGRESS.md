# Lorelight MVP - Build Progress

## ✅ Completed (Phase 1, 2, 3 & Codebase Optimization)

### Codebase Optimization (NEW - Just Completed!)
- ✅ Fixed Supabase client instantiation (lazy loading pattern)

- ✅ Fixed scene reordering to use batch updates (N+1 → single upsert)
- ✅ Removed duplicate campaign header rendering
- ✅ Cleaned up useEffect dependencies (removed fetchedCampaignsRef anti-pattern)
- ✅ Added optimistic updates to stores (update/delete with rollback)
- ✅ Database migration 004: Performance indexes for all tables
- ✅ All ESLint warnings fixed (zero errors, zero warnings)

### Authentication System
- ✅ Supabase client configuration (browser + server)
- ✅ Auth context provider with session sync

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Recent Improvements (Phase 3)
1. **Scene Management**: Full CRUD for campaign scenes with scene types
2. **Tab Performance**: forceMount + smart caching eliminates flashing (<10ms switches)
3. **Scene Activation**: Active scene tracking with visual feedback
4. **Database Schema**: Updated to match existing Lorelight scenes table

### Issues Resolved
1. **Supabase Schema Mismatch**: Fixed database types to match existing Lorelight schema
   - Sessions use `title`, `date`, `description`
   - Scenes use campaign_id (not session_id)
2. **RLS Policy Errors**: Added `TO authenticated` clause to all policies
3. **Immer MapSet Error**: Converted session/scene stores from `Map` to `Record`
4. **Status Check Constraint**: Made status optional in session creation
5. **404 Navigation**: Removed clickable session cards (detail page doesn't exist yet)
6. **Tab Flashing**: forceMount keeps tabs mounted, CSS hides inactive content

### Context7 Principles Applied
- ✅ Performance-first: Minimal state, direct operations, instant tab switching
- ✅ No unnecessary abstractions: Service layer is straightforward
- ✅ Optimistic updates: All stores update UI immediately
- ✅ Persistent state: Critical state saved to localStorage
- ✅ Type safety: Full TypeScript coverage
- ✅ Clean code: All lint rules passing

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Database Types**: Updated to match existing Lorelight production database
2. **Service Layer**: All database operations abstracted for consistency
3. **Zustand**: Using plain objects (Record) instead of Map for better compatibility
4. **Persistence Strategy**: Only persist minimal state (IDs, preferences)
5. **Auth Strategy**: Middleware + context for full coverage
6. **Dark Theme**: Black background (#000000), white text, neutral borders throughout
7. **Tab Performance**: forceMount + smart caching for instant navigation

## 🎉 What's Working Now

1. ✅ **Full authentication flow**: Signup → Login → Protected routes
2. ✅ **Campaign management**: Create, read, update, delete campaigns
3. ✅ **Session management**: Create, read, update, delete sessions
4. ✅ **Scene management**: Create, read, update, delete scenes
5. ✅ **Active session toggling**: Set active/inactive with visual feedback
6. ✅ **Active scene toggling**: Set active/inactive with scene type indicators
7. ✅ **Tabbed navigation**: Instant switching between Sessions and Scenes
8. ✅ **Type-safe operations**: All CRUD operations fully typed
9. ✅ **Dark theme UI**: Consistent black/white design throughout
10. ✅ **Error handling**: Enhanced logging and user-friendly error messages
11. ✅ **GitHub repository**: Code pushed and tracked
