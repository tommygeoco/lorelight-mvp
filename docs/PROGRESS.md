- ✅ **All lint and typecheck passing** ✓
- ✅ Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub

## 🚧 Next Steps (Phase 3 - Scene System)

- [ ] Attach audio to scenes

### Lighting Integration
- [ ] Hue OAuth flow
- [ ] Hue setup page

```

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Issues Resolved
1. **Supabase Schema Mismatch**: Fixed database types to match existing Lorelight schema
   - Sessions use `title`, `date`, `description` instead of `name`, `session_date`, `notes`
2. **RLS Policy Errors**: Added `TO authenticated` clause to all policies
3. **Immer MapSet Error**: Converted session store from `Map<string, Session>` to `Record<string, Session>`
4. **Status Check Constraint**: Made status optional in session creation (nullable in DB)
5. **404 Navigation**: Removed clickable session cards (detail page doesn't exist yet)

### Context7 Principles Applied
- ✅ Performance-first: Minimal state, direct operations
- ✅ No unnecessary abstractions: Service layer is straightforward
- ✅ Optimistic updates: Campaign store updates UI immediately
- ✅ Persistent state: Critical state saved to localStorage
- ✅ Type safety: Full TypeScript coverage
- ✅ Clean code: All lint rules passing

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Database Types**: Updated to match existing Lorelight production database
2. **Service Layer**: All database operations abstracted for consistency
3. **Zustand**: Using plain objects (Record) instead of Map for better compatibility
4. **Persistence Strategy**: Only persist minimal state (IDs, preferences)
5. **Auth Strategy**: Middleware + context for full coverage
6. **Dark Theme**: Black background (#000000), white text, neutral borders throughout

## 🎉 What's Working Now

1. ✅ **Full authentication flow**: Signup → Login → Protected routes
2. ✅ **Campaign management**: Create, read, update, delete campaigns
3. ✅ **Session management**: Create, read, update, delete sessions
4. ✅ **Active session toggling**: Set active/inactive with visual feedback
5. ✅ **Type-safe operations**: All CRUD operations fully typed
6. ✅ **Dark theme UI**: Consistent black/white design throughout
7. ✅ **Error handling**: Enhanced logging and user-friendly error messages
8. ✅ **GitHub repository**: Code pushed and tracked
