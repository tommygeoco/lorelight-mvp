# Tables Already Exist! ✅

## Good News

The error "relation 'campaigns' already exists" means the database tables are **already set up** in your Supabase project from the original Lorelight.

**You don't need to run the migration!** Everything is ready.

## What This Means

The MVP will use the **same tables** as the original Lorelight:
- ✅ `campaigns` table exists
- ✅ `sessions` table exists
- ✅ `scenes` table exists
- ✅ `audio_files` table exists
- ✅ `light_configs` table exists
- ✅ `hue_settings` table exists

## Verify Tables

Check your Supabase dashboard:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hedhioooreyzwotndeqf/editor

You should see all these tables with RLS policies enabled.

## You're Ready to Go!

Just start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000

## Data Compatibility

Since both apps use the same database:
- Data created in the MVP will appear in the original Lorelight
- Data created in the original Lorelight will appear in the MVP
- They're fully compatible!

This is actually a **feature** - you can use whichever UI you prefer while sharing the same campaigns, sessions, and scenes.
